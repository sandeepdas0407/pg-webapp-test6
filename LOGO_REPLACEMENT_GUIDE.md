# P&G Logo Replacement Instructions

## Current Status:
✅ Layout.cshtml has been updated to properly display the P&G logo
✅ CSS styling has been added for the logo with hover effects
✅ Logo is configured to display at optimal size (40px height, auto width)

## To Replace the Logo Image:

1. **Save the P&G logo image** you provided as `pg-logo.png`

2. **Replace the existing file** at:
   ```
   c:\Users\sande\OneDrive\Documents\P&G\Test6 - 2\WebApplication1\wwwroot\images\pg-logo.png
   ```

3. **Recommended image specifications:**
   - Format: PNG (for transparency)
   - Height: 80-120px (will be scaled to 40px for display)
   - Width: Proportional to maintain aspect ratio
   - Background: Transparent preferred

## What's Already Configured:

- ✅ **Layout**: Logo displays in the top navigation bar
- ✅ **Styling**: Professional appearance with hover effect
- ✅ **Responsive**: Scales properly on different screen sizes
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Proper alt text for screen readers

## The logo will appear:
- In the top-left corner of the navigation bar
- At 40px height (auto width to maintain aspect ratio)  
- With a subtle hover effect (1.05x scale)
- Properly aligned with the navigation menu

Once you replace the image file, the new P&G logo will automatically appear on the website!
