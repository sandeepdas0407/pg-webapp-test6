# 🎯 FINAL STEPS TO COMPLETE ALL ACTIVITIES

## ✅ COMPLETED ACTIVITIES:

1. **✅ Git Repository**: Created and all code pushed to https://github.com/sandeepdas0407/pg-webapp-test6
2. **✅ GitHub Actions Workflows**: 3 workflows created and active
3. **✅ Repository Variables**: All Azure variables configured
4. **✅ Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and scripts created
5. **✅ Infrastructure**: Azure resources deployed and running
6. **✅ Application**: Live at https://app-webapp-auvx5tx4cnram.azurewebsites.net

## 🔐 FINAL STEP: AZURE SERVICE PRINCIPAL
