        <h2 class="section-title">Ingredient choices and how we make them</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Some people believe natural product ingredients are safer to use than man-made, synthetic ones. The reality is that it's not that simple; both natural and synthetic ingredients have a safe range and an unsafe range. Even basics like sunlight, oxygen, and water have safety limits. So what goes into choosing our product ingredients?</p>

                    <h3 class="sub-section-title"><span class="number-circle">1</span> Safety</h3>
                    <p>First we define the safe range for every ingredient, whether natural or synthetic. Then we apply the same science-based approach as regulatory agencies around the world.</p>

                    <p>Synthetic ingredients can oftentimes be more sustainable than natural ingredients because they require fewer resources. Sustainable features of a product ingredient depend on the resources used in creating it, harvesting it, making the product and then ultimately using the product. And we're also doing the legwork to ensure we use the most sustainable and earth-friendly solutions.</p>

We will consider new material options as soon as they do arise.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">1,4-dioxane is not an ingredient, but rather a by-product that can form in tiny (trace) amounts when making a variety of ingredients in some cleaning products.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Importantly, the presence of 1,4-dioxane in our products is already well below established safe limits and is in compliance with all government requirements.</p>

While phosphate is naturally present in the environment, it can also be released in much smaller amounts from some cleaning products after their use.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">We've removed phosphates from over 95% of our cleaning products already—and are working to eliminate the remaining 5% from our consumer products over the next few years.</p>

        <p>Preservatives help keep all of us safe by preventing growth of bacteria and mold during the use of consumer products. Different product types need different preservatives that work best for that particular formula. You can rest assured that all of our preservatives comply with applicable regulations and safe limits wherever they are sold.</p>
        
        <p>To find out what preservative is used in your product, you will find more information via <a href="https://smartlabel.org/">Smartlabel®</a> for US and Canada.</p>
        
        <p>A small number of products require a different preservative not listed above, including potassium sorbate, benzalkonium chloride, dehydroaceticacid and chlorhexidine digluconate. They are indicated on the ingredient list in the product used.</p>
